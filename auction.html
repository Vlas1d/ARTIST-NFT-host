Her work has been exhibited in New York, London, Milan, Chicago, and San Francisco and belongs in the collections of the British Museum, Moderna Museet, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Tate, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.<br><br>Applicable sales tax will apply to all works shipped to and within the US.
